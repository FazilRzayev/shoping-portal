# Selling Portal

This is a product selling portal built with React, where users can add products to their basket, see the total calculated price, and remove items they don't want.

I used a lot of Material UI components, including the Drawer for the basket, to create a smooth and user-friendly interface.

The app uses Redux Toolkit to manage state, with asyncThunk to handle asynchronous actions like fetching data using Axios.
